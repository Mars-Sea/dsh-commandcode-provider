# Harness compatibility and installation

- **Isolated package install**: pnpm 10 auto-installs the package's DSH peers
  when a desktop marketplace prepares a fresh generation. Keep
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-invariants` as an explicit peer matching
  the other Harness packages; otherwise pnpm reaches it only through
  `dsh-llm`, rewrites the prerelease range to an unsatisfiable stable range,
  and aborts with `ERR_PNPM_NO_MATCHING_VERSION`. Do not move it to
  `dependencies`: the active profile owns Harness packages. Run
  `npm run test:install` after changing DSH peer metadata. **Client-only UI
  peers the Web frontend already seeds are the ONE exception, and they must stay
  optional AND stay in `devDependencies`** (PR #52). The shipped
  `dsh-web-frontend` hands every client bundle a `staticModules` table —
  `react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, `react-dom`, `react-dom/client`,
  `@deepseek-ai/cordis`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-store`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-slots`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-dockkit` (read out of the 0.2.0-rc.2 engine, and
  re-read at every Harness peer bump: the list is unchanged from 0.1.7-rc.2) — so
  the three `require()` targets `lib/client.js` carries resolve in the webview
  with no installed copy, which is why `react`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives` and
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-slots` are the only peers carrying
  `peerDependenciesMeta.optional: true`. That marking is not cosmetic: an older
  Desktop release validates the entire peer closure of every active plugin
  (`apps/desktop/src/profile-packages.ts`, which honours exactly this field) and
  its runtime tree ships host packages only, so a non-optional client-only peer
  is a hard startup failure there (`desktop profile: … requires missing …`);
  note that current DSH master no longer performs that walk, so the fix unblocks
  the released Desktop builds rather than the newest one. Every OTHER peer stays
  required — a `dsh.client` row is resolved and served by the Host, and a
  harness peer a fresh generation does not install is a bundle that cannot load.
  The second half is the trap the marking opens: **npm and pnpm auto-install only
  NON-optional peers**, so each optional name must also be a `devDependency` or
  the authortime tree silently loses it — `tests/client-boot.test.ts` imports
  the React component tree, so an absent `react` is a red `npm test`, and
  `dsh-client-ui-primitives@0.2.0-rc.2` declares NO dependencies at all, so
  nothing else would pull it in. Note that the same package's npm entry point
  imports `clsx`, `katex` and the shiki/mdast stack without declaring them
  (the ENGINE's own tree does not install them either): it is a seed module,
  resolvable only through a bundler, which is why `tests/_css-module-loader.mjs`
  serves a two-component stub for it and `tsc` still typechecks every call site
  against the package's `.d.ts`. `tests/package.test.ts` pins the exact
  optional set, that every optional name is a declared peer, and that it stays a
  development package.
- **The Harness peer range names exactly ONE release, and that is
  load-bearing.** 使用精确版本 `0.2.0-rc.2`。原 `^0.2.0-rc.2` 会放行
  相邻预发布版及稳定补丁版，并不等于只支持一个版本。That exactness is the point: this bundle is
  maintained against one engine, and a range that quietly admitted a neighbour
  is how a broken pairing stayed invisible (issue #43). A caret once pinned every
  peer to an engine four releases old, so a fresh generation installed a second,
  stale copy of the Harness beside the running engine instead of pairing with it;
  worse, it made `npm test` structurally blind to engine drift, because a
  `link:`-installed profile resolves the plugin's imports from the checkout
  rather than from the engine. The one
  supported range is written VERBATIM in `peerDependencies`, `devDependencies`,
  `dsh.compatibility.dsh` and `engines.dsh`, and `tests/package.test.ts` fails if
  those four drift apart, if the range stops admitting a release that
  `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` calls compatible, or if `dshReleases` grows a
  second record. Move the range and that single record together, and only once
  `npm run test:engine` passes against the new engine.
- **`npm run test:engine` is the only check that can see a bundle which cannot
  load on its engine** (issue #43): it resolves the newest release the manifest
  declares compatible (or `--engine <dir>`, or `$DSH_ENGINE`), copies this
  checkout's PUBLISHED surface into a tree whose peers ARE that engine's, and
  imports the bundle there. A `link:` install cannot substitute for it — the
  plugin's own module directory shadows the engine's, which is exactly how a
  removed export (`offloadRequestImagesWithPolicy` in 0.1.6) shipped green. It
  also audits every static named import against the engine's exports, the client
  bundle's `require()` calls against the platform seed table, the durable
  request-image offload contract the engine exports, and — by instantiating the
  staged adapter — the image pricing that engine's token meter will ask for.
  Being the only check with the engine's own peer tree, it is also where the
  Config schema is proven to drive that engine's settings forms (every field
  marked volatile, parsing to a live reference). Run it before publishing and
  whenever a peer range or an engine version changes.

## 一、账号开通的宿主验证

1. `npm run test:engine` 除加载发布包外，还使用真实 DSH 注册表与网关打开 `enrollmentWatch`，通过网关开始合成手动账号，取消流并确认写入收束后的账号及凭据补偿。设置与凭据使用内存替身；不读真实凭据、不访问真实上游。
2. 当前验证覆盖发布产物、严格描述符、网关接收器和流取消信号。浏览器 WebSocket（网页套接字）物理断连、真实 Studio（登录网站）授权及操作系统强杀仍需实际环境验证，不得由本地绿色检查推定。

## 二、流响应的宿主验证
